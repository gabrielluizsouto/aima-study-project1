# AI Study - Project 1 - Search

## Introduction and context
I am a computer scientist who is deep diving into Artificial Intelligence. 
To achieve my objectives, I am:
- reading the book "Artificial Intelligence, a modern approach" (AIMA) fourth edition from Russel & Norvig
- following the UC Berkeley AI course ministred by John Canny and Oliver Grillmeyer (https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp25/)
  - this course is great because it has classes, based on the AIMA book, that are recorded and posted online, and it also has proposed projects to practice the learnings

The first proposed project from the AI course is on the course´s page (https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su25/projects/proj1/). 
I developed the proposed codes and commited it to this reository.

## Code observations
- My first commit has the base code, containing skeletons of the search trees that needed to be implemented. I added my code in the subsequent commits.
- As described in the project´s page introduction (https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su25/projects/proj1/#introduction), the files I edited are search.py	and searchAgents.py.
