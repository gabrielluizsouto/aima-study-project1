# AI Study - Project 1 - Search

## Introduction and context
I am a computer scientist who is deep diving into Artificial Intelligence. 
To achieve my objectives, I am:
- reading the book "Artificial Intelligence, a modern approach" (AIMA) fourth edition from Russel & Norvig
- following the UC Berkeley AI course ministred by John Canny and Oliver Grillmeyer (https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp25/)
  - This course is great because it has the online classes based on the AIMA book and proposed projects

Here, in this repository, I added the code of the first project. (https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su25/projects/proj1/)

My first commit has the base code, containing skeletons of the search trees that needed to be implemented. I added my code in the subsequent commits.
